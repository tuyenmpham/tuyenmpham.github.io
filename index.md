> "What one man calls God, another calls the laws of physics." - Nikola Tesla 

Welcome to my website! I’m Tuyen, a researcher uncovering the mysteries of the Universe.

My research focuses on cosmology, gravitational physics, and astrophysics including the study of black holes, wormholes, and gravitational waves, as well as the application of quantum physics to gravitation. Currently, I am studying cosmic inflation, a pivotal topic in understanding the origin of the Universe. Here, I’ll share my latest studies and findings in these fascinating fields.
