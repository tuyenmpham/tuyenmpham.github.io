Greetings, My name is Phạm Mạnh Tuyến. I am a researcher in cosmology and gravitational physics, I come from Hai Duong City, Vietnam, where I completed my high school education and pursued part of my seminary studies before delving into my passion for physics. 

I also spent another 4 years studying economics and working for 1 year after graduating to truly understand how much I enjoy science, inspired by reading Carl Sagan's book "Cosmos" and Christopher Nolan's movie "Interstellar"; I was immersed in my love for the vast universe and the mysteries yet to be discovered by humanity. 

Therefore, I decided to retake the university entrance exam and study physics at VNU University of Sciences. Here, I completed my graduation in theoretical physics and mathematical physics with excellent grades.

After receiving a bachelor's degree in physics. I underwent rigorous scientific training, earning my MS in 2022 from the esteemed [Graduate University of Science and Technology](https://gust.edu.vn/vn) at the [Vietnam Academy
of Science and Technology](https://gust.edu.vn/vn).

During my university years, I had the privilege of learning under the mentorship of a physicist [Prof. Nguyễn Xuân Hãn](https://ysip.vnu.edu.vn/cac-nha-khoa-hoc/giao-su-nguyen-xuan-han-1947-2022-nha-phan-bien-giao-duc-sac-sao-day-nghi-luc-va-tam-huyet.html), who greatly influenced my research trajectory. Sadly, he passed away in 2022.

During my master's degree years, I worked in [the Phenikaa Gravitational Physics Group](https://sites.google.com/site/dotocxoan/phenikaa-gravitational-physics-group-pgp-group?authuser=0) under the guidance of [Dr. Tuan Q. Do](https://sites.google.com/site/dotocxoan/), who has now become an Associate Professor at the Phenikaa Institute of Advanced Study (PIAS), Phenikaa University. This experience greatly influenced the direction of my cosmic inflation research.

Here are some memorable moments captured during my academic journey:

After completing my master's program, I am looking for opportunities to study for a Ph.D. in theoretical physics research related to Gravitation and Cosmology.

Beyond the realms of physics, I find joy in reading detective books and comics, backpacking through nature's wonders, and watching science fiction movies. My love for cinema extends to favorites such as the gripping masterpiece 'Interstellar', and the thought-provoking TV series 'Dark' in which a traversable wormhole is possible.
